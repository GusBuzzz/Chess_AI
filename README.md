# Chess_AI

Welcome to the Chess AI repository! This project implements a chess engine that utilizes the minimax algorithm to play the game. 
This Readme file will provide you with all the necessary information to understand, set up, and run the Chess AI on your computer.

Features
The Chess AI comes with the following features:

Minimax algorithm: The AI uses the minimax algorithm, a recursive search algorithm, to evaluate the best move by considering future moves and outcomes.
Google's Guava library: The project incorporates Google's Guava library, which provides additional utility functions to simplify various aspects of the code.

Prerequisites
Before running the Chess AI, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher: The project requires Java to be installed on your computer. I used InteliJ for this project
Google Guava library: Make sure you have the Guava library added as a dependency. The project should include the necessary configuration to fetch it automatically.

Installation
To set up the Chess AI on your computer, follow these steps:

1) Clone the repository to your local machine.
2) Navigate to the project directory.
3) On your preferred IDE make sure that the guava library is installed.
4) Use JChess.java to run the game
